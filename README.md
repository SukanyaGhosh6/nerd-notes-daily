# nerd-notes-daily

This is my open notebook — a growing collection of daily reflections on tech articles I read from serious sources: research labs, universities, and respected tech publications.

Each note here is based on something I found worth thinking about. Sometimes it’s a new idea in AI, other times it's a systems design concept, an algorithm, or something subtle from an academic paper. The point isn’t to summarize everything — it’s to slow down, read deeply, and write clearly.

## Example Topics

- Soft robotics and nature-inspired design at MIT CSAIL  
- Worm-brain-inspired neural networks for real-time AI  
- Compiler internals and language design quirks  
- Research-backed trends in cloud, systems, and security  
- Concepts I never heard before but now can’t stop thinking about

## Why Keep Nerd Notes?

Because the best ideas rarely stick the first time. Writing is a form of debugging for what we read. This repo is where I test my understanding — not to teach, not to perform, just to think better.

If you’re curious too, feel free to poke around.
