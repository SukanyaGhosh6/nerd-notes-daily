## Day 4 — Chaining Vulnerabilities in Ivanti and Fortinet: A Cybersecurity Deep Dive"


In today’s dive into the world of tech and cybersecurity, I came across a fascinating case study involving **vulnerability chaining** — where attackers exploit multiple security flaws together to maximize damage. This isn’t just theoretical; the recent flaws discovered in **Ivanti Connect Secure** and **Fortinet FortiOS** make the scenario all too real.

## The Vulnerabilities in Focus

### CVE-2025-0282 – Ivanti Connect Secure

This vulnerability exists in the `web` binary responsible for handling HTTP and VPN protocol logic — including Ivanti's custom IFT-TLS protocol. The vulnerability is essentially a **stack overflow**, allowing attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code remotely.

The flaw impacts versions prior to **22.7R2.5**, and the company has urged users to upgrade to **version 23.5.2 or higher** to be secure. What struck me here is how critical these gateways (VPNs) are to corporate infrastructure — and how a single flaw in them could allow attackers inside the castle walls, undetected.

### CVE-2024-55591 – Fortinet FortiOS

This one was about an **authentication bypass** vulnerability in the WebSocket module used by FortiOS. Through this flaw, attackers could skip login procedures entirely and reach the admin console.

This doesn't just mean changing settings — we’re talking about:
- Editing firewall rules
- Spinning up rogue administrator accounts
- Rerouting sensitive internal traffic

Affected versions range from **7.0.0 to 7.0.16** (for FortiOS) and similar versions of **FortiProxy**. The recommended fixes are upgrading to **7.0.17 or later**, and where possible, **disabling web-based admin interfaces** altogether.

## Why This Matters: The Power of Vulnerability Chaining

What really fascinated me was the concept of **chaining vulnerabilities** together. On their own, these bugs are dangerous. But used in sequence — say, gaining access through Fortinet, then using Ivanti to escalate privileges — an attacker can gain deeper, stealthier access to a system.

It’s like having both a lockpick and a backdoor key to a house. Even if you fix one lock, you're not safe unless both points are secured.

## Takeaways

1. **Patch often and fast** — this can't be said enough. The exploit window between vulnerability disclosure and real-world attacks is narrowing every year.
2. **Watch your admin interfaces** — many attacks exploit simple oversights like exposed login pages.
3. **Monitor traffic** — unusual lateral movement in internal networks often means attackers are hopping between systems using chained flaws.

## Final Thoughts

These real-world exploits make it very clear how critical layered security really is. It’s not enough to just fix one issue — your security posture has to account for **how attackers think**, which is creatively and opportunistically.

It’s been an eye-opening read today. I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on more vulnerability chaining reports as I continue this blog.
